<ul>
    <li>Check whether the fact information appears somewhere in the <b>infobox or the categories</b>, and if so, click 'correct'.<br>
    <small>(The gray information at the top right of the page gives a hint where the information was extracted. Scroll down to see the Wikipedia page of the second entity.)</small>
    <li>We care whether the fact is <b>correct with respect to Wikipedia</b>, even if Wikipedia might be factually wrong.
	<li>Since our relations are rather abstract, do not be picky about the <b>phrasing</b> of the fact.
    <li>Our facts are <b>time-less</b>, so if the fact holds or held during any point of time, it is correct.
    <li>You do not have to check <b>unit conversions</b> (inches into meters, minute degrees to full degrees, etc.), as long as the value is plausible.<br>
    Rounding errors or close values are OK. The unit 's' is seconds.
    <li>A date such as '<b>1980-##-##</b>' means 'any time during the year 1980'.
    <li>A fact can be correct even if it applies to a <b>fictional</b> entity.
    <li>The facts have been extracted from a Wikipedia dump, so they might be correct but <b>outdated</b> (especially numbers like income, revenue, etc.) - in case of doubt, click 'Ignore' or check the page history.
    <li>If occursSince/occursUntil is given, tell us if each individual start or end time is correct &mdash; no matter whether an end point or a start point is missing in the list.
    <li><font color=red>When in doubt, click 'ignore'</font>
    <li>If your question is not answered here, send a mail to <a href=mailto:edwin@mpi-inf.mpg.de>Edwin</a>.
