<p>Thank you for helping us evaluate YAGO3!
<p>Instructions:
<ul>
<li>You will be shown facts from YAGO.
<li>For each fact, click 'Correct', 'Wrong' or 'Ignore'.
<li>You can start, stop, and resume this evaluation at any time. Every click you make helps us.
<li>Please give us your name, so that we can measure inter-annotator agreement. If you interrupt the evaluation, you can resume it under your name at any time.
<li>When enough facts have been evaluated, we will hold a raffle where you can win an <font color=red>Amazon voucher of 20 EUR</font>.
The probability of winning will be proportional to the number of facts you evaluated. <small>(Fabian is excluded from this raffle)</small>
</ul>
<p>During the evaluation, please consider the following:
<ul>
	<li>The facts have been extracted from Wikipedia. Hence, check whether the fact information appears somewhere in the infobox or the categories, and if so, click 'correct'.</li>
	<li>If in doubt on how to evaluate a fact, click on 'help'
    <li>If you cannot assess the fact, rather than clicking anything else, click 'ignore'
</ul>
